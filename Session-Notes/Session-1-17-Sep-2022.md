COMPUTERS :

SEND Instructions : Processing : OUPUT



M2 - Slot =>



Input
Process
Output

===================================

Able to Programme IT

====================================

Binary Systems / Digital System ?

0
1

Computer Machines :

0 =>
1 => 

Transistor : 

Switches

OFF
ON



s1 0  : No Voltage
s2 1 : Voltage Passing
s3  1 : 
s4
s5
s6

Billions of Transistors, Sandwiched  Wafers=> Processor CPU =>Intel I5, Intel i7



=Instructions  Input=> CPU => OUTPUT

Inputs : keyboard, mouse, touch screen, Line In Microphone
Outputs : Monitor, Speakers,

Showing an Image on a Monitor

Beautiful Landscape Wall paper

0s and 1s

Pixels : RGB 

Red
Green
Blue

Prism => Sunlight => 7 Colors

30s//  60hz frequency Display 



RAM : Random Access Memory => CPU 

**TEMPORARY STORAGE**

**PERMANENT STORAGE :**

HARD DISK : Cylindrical Platters - Moving Cylinders. Magnetic. Magnetic Field will be applied on the disk
SSD :  NO MOVING PARTS.  Data is stored in CHIPS and Not in magnetic form. Stored in Transistors
NAS : Network Attached Storage
EXTERNAL USB DRIVE : Regular USB Drive
Cloud => Connect to Cloud, Dropbox, OneDrive

S3, Cloud Storage



Input Device : Keyboard, Mouse 



Cloud Architect : Who know how to Create the Infrastructure for maximum Reslinecy, Availbility and Scalability

Cloud Engineer : Implements the Plan

Cloud DevOps



CMOS Battery : Small battery : INTERNAL CLOCK : 

Realtime Clocks : Desktops  & Laptops



#### DevOps : => Operational Team

Developer + Operation Team Work Together in s Streamlined Manner to solve the Business Challenges

**Continuous Integration**  : Whenever Code is Committed to Source Control

Develop the code => Commit the Code => Run Automation to Check the Code Quality and Functional Test => 

**Continuous Deployment**  :  Whenever Code is Released/Tags/PR in Source Control

Develop the code => Commit the Code => Run Automation to Check the Code Quality and Functional Test

If it Passes all Validations and meets all Criteria's, DEPLOY to Dev Environment







Developer => Write the Code : EAST : 8 Months

STAKEHOLDER : Confusion?. 

Operation Team : => takes the code and puts on the server : WEST  : 9th Months

deployed :

====================

GOES WRONG : 

=========================

OS : Operating System

====================================================



OS => HARDWARE ?

Windows
Linux
MacOS
Chromebook : ChromeOS



Run Windows on a  macbook?
Run Linux on a macbook

OS is Just a software. => HARDWARE

OS is a BRIDGE to USER and the Hardware



Typing a Text on a keyboard

Keyboard => keyboard driver => OS => Notepad

Saving a File :
Save File Instructions => Notepad => OS => File Save Dialog => name => OS => Data with that filename to the specific Location



Applications :Google Meet



Step :1 :
Step 2 :

As soon as we connected :

Nirmal speaks and its captured in microphone
Nirmal laptop will ask for Permission to access Microphone (Allow, Deny)
OS => Sends a prompt to get Permission user
MICROPHONE Will be allowed to access by Google Meet
Nirmal speech signals are captured as binary form wave
Waves are read by Google meet Software running in the Browser
Binary Waves are sent to Google Server
Google Server will dispatch those Signals to the Other Party : Ehaab

Desktop OS will receive the Waveform in Binary Signals from Google Server
The OS Will notify the Google Meet
Google Meet will received the data and then tries to play in your headphone through OS drivers/functions


all this happens 1 second



# Boolean GATES

TRUE AND FALSE : TRUE
TRUE AND TRUE : TRUE




AND : The output willbe truw when all the AND Conditions are true

OR  : The output will be true atleast 1 of the condition is true

NOR GATES : Negated OR

NAND : NEGATED AND



**candidate 1 :**

Age : 25

Experience is: 2 years

===============================

Will you Hire : ?. No





Age : 40

Experience is: 5 years

Will you Hire : ?. No



**Candidate 3:**

Age : 48

Experience : 3 years

Will you Hire : Yes



age=?
experience=?

Logic : 
if experience is more than or equal to 5 years and Age is more than 25 and less than 40. Hire Him
if experience is less than or equal to 5 years and Age is more than 40 and less than 40. Hire Him

Remaining Scenarios : DON:T HIRE



if( (age>=25 and exp>=5) OR (age>=40and exp<=5) )

{ 

print("you are hired")

}



PSEUDOCODE : Before Monday Session

=======

counter=0;

modulo => %
division => /

for counter=0 to counter=100

​    if (counter is divisble) by 100

​			print(counter)







for counter=0 to counter=100

​    if (counter is divisble) by 100

​			print(counter)



for counter=0 to counter=100 

{

if (counter is divisble) by 100
			print(counter)

}
